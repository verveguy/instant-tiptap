 * ReactScan Component
 *
 * This component integrates react-scan library to enable scanning and monitoring
 * of React components in development. It initializes the scanner on mount and
 * renders nothing visually.
 *
 * The scanner helps with:
 * - Performance monitoring
 * - Component tree visualization
 * - Development debugging
 *
 * Note: This should only be included in development builds as it adds
 * monitoring overhead.
